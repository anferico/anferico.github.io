I am Francesco, an AI Research Engineer with a strong passion for the intersection between AI and language who also deeply enjoys programming and problem solving.

### My story

I have a background in Computer Science from University of Pisa (Italy), where I got my Bachelor's degree in 2016 and my Master's degree in 2018 with a thesis on [Reservoir Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_computing) applied to time series forecasting.

I have been working in the field of AI since December 2018, covering a wide range of topics from traditional Machine Learning and Computer Vision all the way to Natural Language Processing and Speech AI.
